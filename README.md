This project analyzes global well-being using the World Happiness Report datasets across multiple years, focusing on understanding how factors such as economic stability, social support, health, and freedom influence the overall Happiness Score of countries. Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, merging datasets, generating visualizations, and comparing year-wise trends to identify patterns and insights. All code, explanations, and graphs are included in the Jupyter Notebook titled “Global_Happiness_Report_Analysis_by_Anuj_Rasaily_.ipynb”, making the project a comprehensive guide for exploring global happiness patterns through data analytics.
